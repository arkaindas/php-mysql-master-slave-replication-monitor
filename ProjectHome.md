This is a class to monitor and repair MySQL Master/Slave Replication

If setup on a cron job, it will not only check on the health of your
MySQL Replication setup, but it can also be setup to automatically
heal and restart the MySQL Replication.

Self-Healing MySQL Replication is not a new idea, but this is a simple and
clean implementation in PHP.  Anyone familiar with PHP can modify this code
to suit their needs and customize functionality.
